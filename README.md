# Goldbach's Conjecture Solver

This repository contains a simple C++ program named `findPrimes` that
demonstrates Goldbach's Conjecture. According to Goldbach's Conjecture,
every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
This program accepts an even number as an argument and outputs
two prime numbers that sum up to the input number.

## Compilation

The program is written in C++20 and can be compiled with the following command:

```bash
c++ -std=c++20 -O3 -o findPrimes findPrimes.cpp
